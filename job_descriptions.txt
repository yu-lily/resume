CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office
Start date 02/13/2021
Data Engineering Assistant

-Assist in creating tooling using Python and shell scripts to manage data holdings
-Investigate possible avenues of improving AWS backend infrastructure to improve efficiency of processes/reduce costs


- Modernized AWS infrastructure to take advantage of serverless frameworks (Lambda)
- Reduced runtime of batch file conversion job from 12 hours to 5 minutes by containerizing function and leveraging
scalable on-demand compute (Lambda, ECS)
- Saved 50+ engineering hours over one month by creating a reusable system for parallelizing functions formalized
with an Infrastructure as Code framework (AWS CDK)




At CCHDO, I gained firsthand experience working with large volumes of international oceanography data. I saw the challenges that came with scaling up the office's operations,
and learned to use tools to address scalability challenges and write more maintainable code. Stripe operates at an even larger scale than my prior workplaces,
and I would be excited to learn about the challenges faced as well as the solutions used to deal with them.
